Getting Started üöÄ
Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and customization.

1. Installation
First, clone the repository to your local machine:

git clone https://github.com/<your-github-username>/<your-repository-name>.git

Next, navigate into the project directory:

cd <your-repository-name>

Open the folder in your favorite code editor (like VS Code) to start customizing. I recommend using the Live Server extension in VS Code to preview your changes in real-time.

2. Customization
This portfolio is designed to be easily customized. All your personal information is located in the portfolioData object at the top of the script.js file.

Open script.js:

Update the experience array with your work history.

Update the projects array with your personal projects.

Update the skills object with your technical skills, grouped by category.

Update Profile Picture:

In index.html, find the <img> tag inside the "About Me" section.

Replace the https://placehold.co/... URL with a link to your own profile picture.

Update Social Links:

In index.html, find the "Contact" section and update the href attributes for the social links (GitHub, LinkedIn, Email).

Deployment üì¶
The easiest and fastest way to deploy this website is by using GitHub Pages.

Create a Repository:

Create a new public repository on GitHub with the name: <your-github-username>.github.io.

git add .
